      <h2 class="sub-heading">Introduction</h2>
      <p class="post-text">
        Have you ever opened a website on your phone and found it hard to read
        because the text was too small or the layout was broken? Thatâ€™s what
        happens when a website is not responsive. Responsive Web Design (RWD) is
        the practice of making websites look good and function well on all
        devices â€” desktops, tablets, and smartphones.
      </p>

      <h2 class="sub-heading">What is Responsive Web Design?</h2>
      <p class="post-text">
        Responsive Web Design ensures that a single website adapts to different
        screen sizes and resolutions. It uses: Flexible layouts â†’ Grids that
        resize based on screen width. Fluid images â†’ Images that shrink or
        expand to fit the container. Media queries â†’ CSS rules that change the
        design for specific screen sizes. ðŸ‘‰ Example: A navigation bar may
        appear as a full menu on desktop, but collapse into a hamburger menu on
        mobile.
      </p>
      <h2 class="sub-heading">Why Responsive Design Matters</h2>
      <p class="post-text">
        User Experience (UX) â†’ Visitors can browse easily without zooming or
        scrolling awkwardly. SEO Benefits â†’ Google ranks responsive websites
        higher in search results. One Website for All Devices â†’ No need to build
        a separate mobile site. Higher Engagement â†’ People stay longer and are
        more likely to return.
      </p>

      <h2 class="sub-heading">My Study Method for Responsive Design</h2>
      <p class="post-text">
        Hereâ€™s how I personally learn responsive web design: YouTube Tutorials â†’
        I start with free playlists that explain media queries, Flexbox, and CSS
        Grid. Practice Projects â†’ I build small websites (like my Coffee Website
        and Honey Website) and make them mobile-friendly. Imitation Learning â†’ I
        watch developers build responsive websites and try to copy them line by
        line, understanding how they adapt layouts. Certifications â†’ I use
        LinkedIn Learning (via NMSkills) and Coursera for structured learning
        and certificates that validate my skills.
      </p>

      <h2 class="sub-heading">Tools & Techniques You Should Know</h2>
      <img src="sss.png" alt="Tools & Techniques" class="post-imggg" />
      <p class="post-text">
        Flexbox & CSS Grid â†’ For flexible layouts. Responsive Images â†’ Using
        max-width: 100% and height: auto. Testing Tools â†’ Chrome DevTools for
        simulating different devices.
      </p>

      <h2 class="sub-heading">Conclusion</h2>
      <p class="post-text">
        Responsive Web Design is not optional â€” itâ€™s essential. In todayâ€™s
        world, most users browse from mobile devices, and a website that isnâ€™t
        mobile-friendly risks losing visitors. 
        
        <pre>By learning media queries,
        Flexbox, and Grid, and practicing with real projects, you can master
        responsiveness and make your websites professional and user-friendly.</pre>
